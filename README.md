Project completed by Michael Keyser, Shaun McKellar, and Jason Howard.

The aim of this project is to learn about designing filters in MATLAB. There are two distinct parts.
1) P-13: Encoding and Decoding Touch-Tone (DTMF) Signals
Lab exercise 4 in this link https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/07dtft/labs/DTMFdecodeLab/DTMFdecodeLab.pdf

2) S-6: FIR Filter Design GUI
Lab exercise 2 in this link: https://dspfirst.gatech.edu/chapters/07dtft/labs/FIRfilterDesign/FIRfilterDesign.pdf

All code for (1) is in the directory LabP13_Exercise4. All code for (2) is in the directory LabS6_Exercise2.
